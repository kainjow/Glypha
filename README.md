This is an in-progress port of Glypha III from its Mac OS/QuickDraw version (1995) to cross platform and OpenGL.

> Glypha III is a classic arcade game originally created by John Calhoun in which you are placed inside an Egyptian temple with only your lance and a winged steed to aid you. Here you are forced to do battle with Sphinxes in order to gain the honour of a place on the High Scores list. The game is based on Joust and features sound and the original animated graphics.

###TODO###

- Implement high score list
- Finish Linux/Qt port
